CSS-Refresher
=============

Refresh CSS files on demand or timed.

Refresh CSS files without reloading the page. This is a non jQuery script that I wanted to keep light and fast for deployment. Add the script to your page but do not leave it on the page when you send the site to production. Change the button css to position it somewhere on the page so you can find it and use it. Holding Alt when you click will set up the auto reloading function that reloads the scripts every second but keeps the main script reference so you can still use firebug or dev tools, just make sure you add styles/ elements to the main style sheet.
